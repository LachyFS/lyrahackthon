# Hackthon Brief:
# Background
The technology industry is experiencing an unprecedented talent shortage. As AI capabilities accelerate and tech companies race to build the next generation of products, the competition for engineering talent has reached fever pitch.

## The Numbers Tell the Story
Sign-on bonuses at leading AI labs now regularly exceed $1-2M for top researchers, with some packages reaching $5-10M for exceptional talent
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and Meta are engaged in aggressive talent acquisition, often poaching entire research teams
The global developer shortage is projected to reach 85 million workers by 2030
Time-to-hire for senior engineers averages 49 days, with companies losing top candidates to competitors during lengthy processes
73% of recruiters say finding qualified tech talent is their biggest challenge

## The War on Multiple Fronts
This isn't just about AI researchers. The talent war extends across the entire tech ecosystem:

### For Companies:
Sourcing quality candidates from an ever-shrinking pool
Competing with tech giants offering unprecedented compensation
Identifying genuine skill vs. credential inflation
Reducing time-to-hire while maintaining quality
Managing candidate experience in a candidate-driven market
### For Candidates:
Drowning in recruiter spam and irrelevant opportunities
Difficulty finding roles that match their actual skills and ambitions
Lack of transparency around compensation, culture, and growth
Navigating competing offers without proper information
For the Industry:
Massive inefficiencies in matching supply and demand
Talent concentrated in a handful of companies
Promising startups unable to compete for mid-senior talent


## The Challenge
Build a working tool that fundamentally changes how tech talent and opportunities connect.
Your solution should address one or more aspects of the recruiting problem. This could be:
Sourcing & Discovery
Tools to help find and identify technical talent
Data should be sourced via your own means (apify.com is great if you want to avoid manual scraping)
Matching & Qualification
Systems that match candidates to roles based on actual capability, not just credentials
Process & Experience
Reducing time-to-hire without sacrificing quality
Streamlining interview processes or candidate evaluation
Market Dynamics
Creating fairer compensation benchmarking
Enabling better information flow about companies and opportunities

# Requirements
Your submission must:
Be a working prototype (not just slides or mockups)
Address a specific pain point in the talent acquisition/job search process
Demonstrate technical implementation
Be presentable in a 4-minute pitch

## Impact
Does this solve a real, specific pain point in tech recruiting?
Would people actually use this solution?
Is it practical and applicable to the real world?

## Technical Execution
Is it a working prototype (not just slides)?
How deep and thoughtful are your technical choices (e.g. what were your decisions in collecting data)?
Does the core functionality actually work?

## What we're looking for:
Working demos over fancy presentations
Functionality first approach (might not need a frontend -> could be a n8n workflow)
Solutions that create genuine value (not just another generic marketplace like indeed or seek)
