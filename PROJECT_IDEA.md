# DevShowcase

A visual social platform for software engineers. GitHub-native, project-focused, less corporate than LinkedIn.

## Concept

Engineers log in with GitHub. We auto-generate a profile from their repos, languages, and activity. They share what they're building through visual posts — screenshots, demos, code snippets. It's about showing work, not polishing resumes.

## Core Scope (MVP)

- **GitHub OAuth** with auto-generated profiles
- **Post projects** with images and repo links
- **Feed** of posts from people you follow
- **Discover** engineers by tech stack
- **Social features**: likes, comments, follows

## Possible Extensions

- "Looking for collaborators" flag on posts
- Trending posts / weekly digest
- One-click import any repo as a post
- DMs or connection requests
- Job board integration (companies browse by stack)
- Repo activity feed (auto-post when you ship)
- Code snippet posts with syntax highlighting
- Short video demos (screen recordings)
- Endorsements for specific technologies
- Team profiles for open source projects

## Out of Scope for MVP

- Messaging
- Notifications
- Algorithmic feed
- Analytics

## Hackathon Demo Flow

1. Log in with GitHub
2. See your auto-generated profile
3. Browse the discover feed
4. Create a post linking one of your repos
5. Follow someone
6. Done!
